## Features

- **Homepage** with an introduction, links to all product categories, and a new Disney-inspired background for an immersive feel.
- **Product Catalog Pages**: Each category has a dedicated PHP page (Toys, Clothing, Collectibles) with:
    - **Dynamic Stock Toggle**: Show or hide available stock for each product.
    - **Quantity Controls**: Adjust quantity using `+` and `-` buttons, capped by the available stock. Quantities are dynamically passed to the cart upon addition.
    - **Image Zoom Feature**: Enlarge images in a new window by clicking, with a close option for a better view.
- **Shopping Cart**:
    - **Add to Cart Functionality**: Cart items are stored in the session, with quantities managed through user-selected values.
    - **Session-based Storage**: Keeps cart information for the session duration.
- **Contact Form**: Validates user input on both client and server sides, highlighting any issues directly for the user and ensuring all fields are correctly formatted.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Footer with Sticky Positioning**: Ensures a consistent footer position at the bottom of all pages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the content for each page.
- **CSS**: Provided styles for layout, spacing, color, and a custom Disney-inspired background.
- **JavaScript**: Enabled dynamic elements (stock toggle, quantity controls, image zoom, form validation).
- **PHP**: Managed backend functionalities:
  - Handled session management for the shopping cart.
  - Enabled file includes for a clean, modular layout (e.g., header and footer).
  - Validated contact form server-side to enhance security.
- **Git**: Version control for managing project updates.
